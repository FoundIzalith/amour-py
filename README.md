# amour-py

amour-py is a Discord bot I made in my spare time for fun. 

She lives in my D&D group and is based on a character I played some years ago. 

Originally, Amour was written in C#, but I lost her original code a long time ago and I decided to recreate her in Python so that I could learn the language.
